# TokenisationThesis

This GitRepo contains the code which was developed for the section called "Tokenisation as a Portfolio and Risk Management Tool" as part of my master thesis titled 
"Tokenisation of Energy Assets: A Novel Approach to Financing the Clean Energy Transition"

For the thesis, a two step analysis framework was developed. The first step includes Monte Carlo simulations of energy asset returns, the second step contains portfolio optimisation based on mean-variance portfolio analysis. Each file in this GitRepo contains the code for one of the aforementioned steps. The first file contains the Monte Carlo Simulation of Discounted Cashflow Models of different Energy Projects. The second file contains the optimal portfolio algorithm based on mean-variance analysis.
